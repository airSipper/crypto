[sowpods.txt](./sowpods.txt)
 -- This is an english dictionary. Its ~260,000 words are uppercase. One word/line.

[substitution.py](./substitution.py)
 -- This is a simple substitution cipher. It takes a string from the user,
 strips the punctuation and forces it into uppercase. It then transposes
 the characters and returns the ciphertext in blocks of 5 letters.
 It's also possible to decrypt a ciphertext that has been encoded with this cipher.
